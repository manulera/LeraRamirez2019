     `segmentation` is a distance, which affects the precision by which the
     shape of a filament is simulated. Specificially, the number of segments 
     used for a filament of length `L` is the integer `N` that minimizes:
     @code
     fabs( L / N - segmentation )
     @endcode
     
     As a rule of thumb, segmentation should scale with rigidity, depending on 
     the expected magnitude of the forces experienced by the filament:
     @code
     segmentation = sqrt(rigidity/force)
     force ~ rigidity / segmentation^2
     @endcode
     
     Generally, a simulation should not be trusted if any filament contains kinks
     (i.e. if the angle between consecutive segments is greater then 45 degrees).
     In that case, the simulation should be redone with a segmentation divided by 2,
     and the segmentation should be reduced until kinks do not appear.
