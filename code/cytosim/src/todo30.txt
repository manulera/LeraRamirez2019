Cytosim Todo List
F. Nedelec

----------------------- Bugs

- placement of nucleus in pombe.cym
- diffusion of a looped filament
- Display parameter such as 'tile': command line do not overwrite

----------------------- Essential

- Implement continuous attractive potential for 'steric interactions'
- Avoid discontinuity when attraction is on
- Calibrate end-to-end distance of semi-flexible filaments
- Calibrate rotational diffusion of filaments

----------------------- Important

- Fiber::read should allow changing 'activity'
- Geometrical primitives (eg. rectangle) should use diameter and not radius
- add units to documentation of parameters

----------------------- Improvements

- RigidFiber could be named RigidFilament
- FiberBinder could incorporate the functionalities of Digit, Digit would be removed
- fiber:max_length could trigger switch to a different Dynamic state
- Could add color of Hands for summary obtained with 'I'
- Update OpenGL code to use Shadders and no immediate rendering
- Equilibrate a filament configuration, based on its persistence length
- Implement two confinements for Mecables. That's easier than constructive geometry on Spaces

----------------------- Spindles

- We want the substance to accumulate at the poles:
  - saturation of chewing from the fiber tips
  - non-linear cutting from lattice?
  - saturating transport on lattice: convection stalls above a certain concentration

----------------------- To reach v4

- Implement new 3D SideInteraction with vector product + include Maxima code in doxycomments
- Extend 'properties.cmo' to be able to store multiple time-points
- Find a solution for 'confine = type, stiff, space' and 'confine = type, space' in Single.
- Finish Event class

- add generic classes that can be customized: OpenFiber, OpenHand, OpenCouple, OpenSingle...
- fix SpaceBead: list of beads not set correctly after a read state.cym
- binding_range warnings are not necessary for long Couples


Reorganize the cym folder:
  -> simple examples organised as a tutorial
  -> tests + reference
  -> research
test write / read systematically on all cym files

- Review the syntax of the config file

----------------------- Dissemination

- create a Vanilla version of Cytosim where Hands, Single, Couple and Fiber are plain (no derived) classes
- Video tutorial to install and run cytosim (pombe simulation)
- Video tutorial to do something simple (self-organization / contraction?)
- IKEA/LEGO style step-by-step manual with minimal text
- Bare-bone version of Cytosim for contract (no field, no bead, merge PointSet & Mecable)
- create an config file editor with a 'run' button on top, alike Processing
- create syntax-color highligting file for cytosim, in some editor
- create 2D tutorial on how to place objects
- complete public version without sensitive code
- organize 3rd CYTOSIM practical course in Porquerolles (yeah!)
- export to X3D format, and install viewer within a browser

----------------------- Future work:

- Represents an actin filament with two strands... a microtubule with 13.
- New space CylinderX equivalent to CylinderZ, but in the X direction

Build:

- build with modern 'make' like
    scons: http://www.scons.org instead of make
    cmake: http://www.cmake.org
- Consider Replacing GLUT:
    glfw:  http://www.glfw.org/index.html
    Qt  :  http://qt.digia.com
- new font renderer, eg. FreeType (http://www.freetype.org/index.html)
problem for off-screen: glutBitmapCharacter() requires GLUT to be initialized.

----------------------- Performance:

- use DIM==4 for 3D simulations in which vectors have a stride of 4
- update SIMD code to use AVX (256-bit register) and FMA (fused-add-multiply)
- implement IDRS to replace BICGSTAB - convergence in matlab seems better
  http://ta.twi.tudelft.nl/nw/users/gijzen/IDR.html
- Use Pardiso matrix & solver
- multi-thread the steric engine
- try direct sparse method: HSL MA27 http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/index.html

----------------------- Examples:

  Would be great to revive the old models:
- yeast_karyogamy.cym
- spindle.cym: Rose's spindle model
- pombe_bundle.cym : bundle formation
  New:
- some DNA binding/unbinding
- dynamic ring of growing filaments
- slider that does not detach + Jam on lattice (Marcel Janson)

----------------------- Input/Output:

- reorganize the Input classes IOWrapper
- include error reporting inside Input class
   - collect errors in local string
   - clearErrors() getErrors()
- new MSG : we need a modern logging class built on a stream
- in properties.cmo, we have "set couple 2 motor" but "set couple2 motor" would be better

----------------------- New Developments:

- Steric interaction limited to nearest neighbors, instead of a fixed cut-off distance
- Remove discontinuity in the piece-wise linear force (at steric_range + steric_radius)
- steric_range specified directly, and not 'extra' range. Test that steric_range > steric_radius

- A level-set based Space to import images (2D sufficient initially)
- Continuous steric: integrate force over segment length
- Review & port Antonio's Meca::addTorqueClamp()
- Couple::Fork implements Antonio's forks (Antonio did this)
- a Space to represent a lamellipodium: like a capsule in Y&Z, periodic in X
- extensions of fast_diffusion:
   - constant concentration of free molecules (Jonathan)
   - dirichlet boundary conditions: set concentration of molecules at edges of Space

- remove variadic functions (#include <stdarg>)
- option to pull on beads with mouse
- use posSide() for display more systematically
- Crank-Nicholson diffusion in Field (Jonathan did this)
- class Event to control the value of a parameter in time, or execute arbitrary code
   can replace the 'event' parameter of command 'run'.
- include simple math evaluation tool, to be able to use '10*time+5' (muParser? Lua?)

----------------------- New molecular activities:

- implement specialized motor classes: Kinesin, Dynein & Myosin
- new Hand with capping activity (Request Marko Kaksonen)

- steric between beads and fibers, but not fiber-fiber
- stabilize the steric interactions of particles: solid.cym

- new Space in 3D defined as the intersection of an arbitrary number of half-spaces
- LevelSet volumes
- translated/rotated Space

- Glossary could record the queries and use this information for error reporting:
  the parameter 'confined' was unused, but a query was made for 'confine'
- select the type of lattice in Fiber: latticeReal() or latticeInt()

----------------------- Graphics:

- Update OpenGL code: do not use any direct rendering method
- Improve control of whether bound Hands are hidden if fiber->disp->visible==0
- use VBO to display each fiber with style=1 and 2
- SimThread can store two simulation states, such as to be able to flip back-and-forth quickly.
- depth-sorting of fiber segment: displayTFiber(Fiber *, int inx)
- stereoscopic display for 3D

----------------------- Misc:

- PlayProp::on_click : a code executed while clicking the mouse
- PlayProp::on_motion : a code executed while moving the mouse
- OpenGL slider to change parameter value:
   - setup by a command in config.cym: slider actin:rigidity { range = 0, 1; }
