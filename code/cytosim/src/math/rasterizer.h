/// 2D and 3D rasterizer
/**
 The different functions in the rasterizer call a given method func() for every point 
 of INTEGER coordinates inside a certain volume.
 
 The volume can be specified in two ways:
 - as a polygon described by a list of points, using paintPolygon?D(polygon) 
 - as a cylinder specified by two points P,Q and a scalar 'radius'.
 In 3D, the functions do not rasterize a cylinder, but rather a rectangular volume
 that contains all the points located at distance radius or less from [PQ].

 Important note:   The points defining the polygon do not need to be integers.
